      <p class="mb-4">Artificial intelligence is often described as a force of acceleration—an engine that propels us forward, sometimes faster than we can process. But progress, I’ve learned, is not just about speed. It’s about direction, intention, and above all, discipline.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Discipline is the quiet architect behind every meaningful achievement. In the age of AI, where information is abundant and distractions are infinite, discipline becomes our compass. It’s what allows us to harness technology thoughtfully, to use AI as a tool for growth rather than a crutch for convenience.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">I’ve found that the most profound insights come not from the algorithms themselves, but from the habits we build around them. The discipline to learn, to question, to pause and reflect—these are the practices that illuminate our path, even as the world changes at an unprecedented pace.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">As I continue to explore the intersection of design, technology, and human potential, I’m reminded that AI is only as powerful as the discipline we bring to its use. Progress is not a product of automation alone, but of the choices we make, day after day, to pursue excellence with intention.</p>
